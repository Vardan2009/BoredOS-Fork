# Bored OS 1.50

BoredOS is now in a Beta stage as i have brought over all apps from boredkernel and have made the DE a lot more usable and stable.
## Boredkernel is now BoredOS!
Boredkernel will from now on be deprecated as it's core became too messy. I have built a less bloated kernel and wrote a DE above it, which is why it is now an OS instead of a kernel (in my opinion).

Bored Kernel is a simple x86_64 hobbyist operating system.
It features a DE (and WM), a FAT32 filesystem, customizable UI and much much more!

## Features
- Bored WM
- Fat 32 FS
- 64-bit long mode support
- Multiboot2 compliant
- Text editor
- IDT
- Ability to run on actual x86_64 hardware
- CLI

## Prerequisites

To build BoredOS, you'll need the following tools installed:

- **x86_64 ELF Toolchain**: `x86_64-elf-gcc`, `x86_64-elf-ld`
- **NASM**: Netwide Assembler for compiling assembly code
- **xorriso**: For creating bootable ISO images
- **QEMU** (optional): For testing the kernel in an emulator

On macOS, you can install these using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install x86_64-elf-binutils x86_64-elf-gcc nasm xorriso qemu
```

## Building

Simply run `make` from the project root:

```sh
make
```

This will:
1. Compile all kernel C sources and assembly files
2. Link the kernel ELF binary
3. Generate a bootable ISO image (`boredos.iso`)

The build output is organized as follows:
- Compiled object files: `build/`
- ISO root filesystem: `iso_root/`
- Final ISO image: `boredos.iso`

## Running

### QEMU Emulation

Run the kernel in QEMU:

```sh
make run
```

Or manually:
```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -serial stdio -cdrom boredos.iso -boot d
```

### Running on Real Hardware

*Warning: This is at YOUR OWN RISK. This software comes with ZERO warranty and may break your system.*

1. **Create bootable USB**: Use [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash `boredos.iso` to a USB drive

2. **Prepare the system**:
   - Enable legacy (BIOS) boot in your system BIOS/UEFI settings
   - Disable Secure Boot if needed

3. **Boot**: Insert the USB drive and select it in the boot menu during startup

4. **Tested Hardware**:
   - HP EliteDesk 705 G4 DM (AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 2400G, Radeon Vega)
   - Lenovo ThinkPad A475 20KL002VMH (AMD Pro A12-8830B, Radeon R7)

## Project Structure

- `src/kernel/` - Main kernel implementation
  - `boot.asm` - Boot assembly code
  - `main.c` - Kernel entry point
  - `*.c / *.h` - Core kernel modules (graphics, interrupts, filesystem, etc.)
  - `cli_apps/` - Command-line applications
  - `wallpaper.ppm` - Default desktop wallpaper
- `build/` - Compiled object files (generated during build)
- `iso_root/` - ISO filesystem layout (generated during build)
- `limine/` - Limine bootloader files (downloaded automatically)
- `linker.ld` - Linker script for x86_64 ELF
- `limine.conf` - Limine bootloader configuration
- `Makefile` - Build configuration and targets
